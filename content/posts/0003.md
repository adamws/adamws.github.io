Let's create KiCad project using [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and [kbplacer](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer).
Although ergogen is capable of generating KiCad PCB files, I will be using it only
to create key matrix layout. This will result in more traditional KiCad project
structure including schematic.

Footprints placement and some initial routing will be handled by kbplacer.

## Get ergogen points file

Ergogen configuration is beyond the scope of this tutorial, for simplicity I will be
using web-based deployment at [ergogen.cache.works](https://ergogen.cache.works/).

To learn how this ergogen's layout description format works see [ergogen docs](https://docs.ergogen.xyz/).
For demonstration purposes I selected `Absolem (simplified)` preset to which I added
rows and columns nets. This is not required but it will save me some work in next step.
Details about matrix annotations can be found in [flatfootfox guide](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part3-pcbs/).

```diff
 points:
   zones:
     matrix:
       anchor:
         rotate: 5
       columns:
         pinky:
+          key.column_net: C0
         ring:
           key.splay: -5
           key.origin: [-12, -19]
           key.stagger: 12
+          key.column_net: C1
         middle:
           key.stagger: 5
+          key.column_net: C2
         index:
           key.stagger: -6
+          key.column_net: C3
         inner:
           key.stagger: -2
+          key.column_net: C4
       rows:
         bottom:
+          row_net: R2
+          mirror.row_net: R6
         home:
+          row_net: R1
+          mirror.row_net: R5
         top:
+          row_net: R0
+          mirror.row_net: R4
     thumbfan:
       anchor:
         ref: matrix_inner_bottom
         shift: [-7, -19]
       columns:
         near:
+          key.column_net: C2
         home:
           key.spread: 21.25
           key.splay: -28
           key.origin: [-11.75, -9]
+          key.column_net: C3
         far:
           key.spread: 21.25
           key.splay: -28
           key.origin: [-9.5, -9]
+          key.column_net: C4
       rows:
         thumb:
+          row_net: R3
+          mirror.row_net: R7
   rotate: -20
   mirror:
     ref: matrix_pinky_home
     distance: 223.7529778
```

Now I can run *Generate* and download `points.yml` file which will be used by kbplacer.

## Convert ergogen points to KLE layout

From now on, I will be using kbplacer which is python package using KiCad's python API.
For installation options see [installation guide](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

First I will install it in virtual environment in newly created project directory:

```shell
mkdir absolem-kbplacer && cd absolem-kbplacer
python -m venv --system-site-packages .env
. .env/bin/activate
pip install kbplacer
```

On Windows use python distributed with KiCad, otherwise kbplacer will not have access to KiCad's bindings.

Now, to convert ergogen points file to KLE layout run:

```shell
python -m kbplacer.kle_serial -in points.yaml -inform ERGOGEN_INTERNAL \
  -outform KLE_RAW -out absolem-kle.json
```

The resulting file can be imported by [keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/):

![absolem-keyboard-layout](/img/0003/absolem-keyboard-layout.png)

## Generate KiCad schematic

To generate KiCad schematic I will use example kbplacer tool which currently is not a part
of the package itself. It is just a single script with one dependency so it should be easy to run.
Within previously initialized python virtual environment run:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer/master/tools/layout2schematic.py
pip install kicad-skip==0.2.5
```

**Warning** kbplacer currently supports only [VIA style](https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/layouts#switch-matrix-co-ordinates) switch matrix labels,
run simple search & replace first to change `R0,C0` to `0,0` etc. For example: `sed -i 's/[RC]//g' absolem-kle.json`

To generate new schematic file run:

```shell
 python layout2schematic.py -in absolem-kle.json -out absolem.kicad_sch
```

The result should be as following:

![schematic](/img/0003/schematic.png)

Generation of MCU circuit is not automatic. It can be added later, for this tutorial I skip it entirely.
Remember to assign footprints to symbols. To do it in bulk use `Tools->Asign Footprints...`.

Then create PCB and import changes from schematic.

In order to place and route imported footprints, use kbplacer again. For details
how to use it from CLI see `python -m kbplacer --help` output.

In order to use it with GUI from KiCad, install it as [kicad plugin](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-as-kicad-plugin).
Plugin icon will appear on the toolbar. Start it to see something like this:

![pcb-before](/img/0003/pcb-before.png)

In this instance I'm using previously generated layout file with `Relative` position diode option
and automatic routing enabled. This way the plugin will replicate my first switch-diode pair connection for
remaining switches. See [options overview](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer?tab=readme-ov-file#options-overview) to learn more.

After clicking **OK** I got following result:

![pcb-after](/img/0003/pcb-after.png)

And that is all. The process requires some manual steps (i.e. assigning footprints, importing schematic to PCB)
but this can be improved in the future.
